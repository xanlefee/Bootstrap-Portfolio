# Bootstrap-Portfolio
#A portfolio built using bootstrap.




This is a bootstrap portfolio of my web projects to date, with an about me, work & contact section. Bootstrap elements such as cards, jumbotron and navbar have been used and customised. 

Users can navigate the portfolio by clicking on the navigation bar and the page will automatically scroll. Buttons have an overlay shadow. The nav bar is also fixed at the top of the page on scroll.

There are links to deployed web applications in the work section which change opacity on hover.. There is also a CV download button and links to my various contact methods in the footer section which open in a new tab when clicked.

In the footer there is also a link that when clicked, opens an email form. The application will resize to any container so is suitable for web, mobile and tablet displays.

Initially I had issues customising the font however I did this using the '!imporant' value.
